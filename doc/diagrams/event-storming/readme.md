# Event Storming

In this version was described just the following business flow:
 - Order created by the customer and payment has been confirmed
 - Order created by the customer and payment has been rejected

The following image describes those flows:
![business flow](flows.jpg?raw=true "business flow")

The final process has aggregates and bounded contexts defined:
![complete](aggregates-bounded-contexts.jpg?raw=true "complete")

Due to the low quality of the images, the complete diagram could be viewed directly on Miro:
